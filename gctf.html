    <p>GCTF was held on December 20th 2024, 10:00:00 pm GMT+8 to December 22nd 2024, 10:00:00 am GMT+8
        and was hosteed by Singapore Poly (SP).
        Overall a really beginner-friendly CTF 
    </p>
    <p>(I have to admit I wasn't a big fan of the pwn due to a extra singular step that had to be done which was "intetntional" so)</p>
