    <p>GCTF was held on December 20th, 2024, 10:00:00 PM GMT+8 to December 22nd, 2024, 10:00:00 AM GMT+8 and was hosted by Singapore Poly (SP). Overall, a really beginner-friendly CTF.</p>
    <p>(I have to admit I wasn't a big fan of the pwn due to an extra singular step that had to be done which was "intentional".)</p>
